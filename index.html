    <!--
        This example uses: 
        
        - Infinite Scroll JavaScript plugin by metafizzy (Another plugin called imagesLoaded is included with the InfiniteScroll plugin)
        https://infinite-scroll.com/
        https://imagesloaded.desandro.com/

        - Isotope JavaScript Plugin by metafizzy (Isotope also includes Masonry in their JavaScript File)
        https://isotope.metafizzy.co/
        https://masonry.desandro.com/

        They can be initialized by JavaScript, JQuery or CDN (Content Delivery Network)
        This isn't perfect and I recommend to use the JQuery version as it's much more supported with the official guides.
        For simplicity, I will use the JavaScript files.

        I will use images from 1.png 2.png 3.png 4.png as example images for this example

        Infinite Scroll works on a container element with item elements.

        You can add posts with varied widths and heights by add CSS to it.

        This specific script has to be place at the end of the HTML Infinite Scroll Code instead of above the Infinite Scroll code otherwise it will fail to load the plugin.

    <!-- BUGS: For some reason, video files can overlap with the other posts. This could be avoided by specifying the post item height in the html tags, wrapping the isotope javascript initialization in the imagesLoaded initialization or using isotope to add a sort by original order at the end of every container div -->

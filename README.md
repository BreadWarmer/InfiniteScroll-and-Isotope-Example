# InfiniteScroll-and-Isotope-Example
IMPORTANT: Infinite Scroll will not work when opened locally, it must be hosted with a local http server. You can host one with this site with node.js or visual studio code live server extension.
A clearer example of a website containing the InfiniteScroll and Isotope JS Plugin made by metafizzy in vanilla JavaScript.

InfiniteScroll appends posts from another page without having a backend, mansonry is for the layout for the posts similar to pinterest (like bricklaying), isotope can sort and filter the posts and finally imagesLoaded will makes sure the images are loaded first before the InfiniteScroll appends them.

This example uses: 
        
        - Infinite Scroll JavaScript plugin by metafizzy (Another plugin called imagesLoaded is included with the InfiniteScroll plugin)
        https://infinite-scroll.com/
        https://imagesloaded.desandro.com/

        - Isotope JavaScript Plugin by metafizzy (Isotope also includes Masonry in their JavaScript File)
        https://isotope.metafizzy.co/
        https://masonry.desandro.com/

They can be initialized by JavaScript, JQuery or CDN (Content Delivery Network)
This isn't perfect and I recommend to use the JQuery version as it's much more supported with the official guides.
For simplicity, I will use the JavaScript files.

I will use images from 1.png 2.png 3.png 4.png as example images for this example.

Everything else should be in the comments inside the html/css/javascript files.

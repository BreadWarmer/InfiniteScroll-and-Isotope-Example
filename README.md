# InfiniteScroll-and-Isotope-Example
A clearer example of a website containing the InfiniteScroll and Isotope JS Plugin made by metafizzy in vanilla JavaScript.

This example uses: 
        
        - Infinite Scroll JavaScript plugin by metafizzy (Another plugin called imagesLoaded is included with the InfiniteScroll plugin)
        https://infinite-scroll.com/
        https://imagesloaded.desandro.com/

        - Isotope JavaScript Plugin by metafizzy (Isotope also includes Masonry in their JavaScript File)
        https://isotope.metafizzy.co/
        https://masonry.desandro.com/

They can be initialized by JavaScript, JQuery or CDN (Content Delivery Network)
This isn't perfect and I recommend to use the JQuery version as it's much more supported with the official guides.
For simplicity, I will use the JavaScript files.

I will use images from 1.png 2.png 3.png 4.png as example images for this example.

Everything else should be in the comments inside the html/css/javascript files.
